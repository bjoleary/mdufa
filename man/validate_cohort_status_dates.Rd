\title{Validate Cohort Status Matches Data Report Dates}
\usage{
validate_cohort_status_dates(data, cohort_status)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Performance metrics data frame. Must contain \code{report_date},
\code{fy}, and \code{org} columns.}

\item{cohort_status}{Cohort status data frame. Must contain \code{report_date},
\code{fy}, and \code{org} columns.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns TRUE if validation passes. Issues a warning
if mismatches are detected.
}
\description{
Checks that cohort status data comes from the same reports as the
performance metrics data. This ensures that cohort closure percentages
accurately reflect the state of submissions at the time the performance
metrics were measured.
}
\details{
For each unique combination of (fy, org) in the data, this function
verifies that the most recent report_date in data matches the report_date
in cohort_status. Mismatches indicate that the cohort closure status
may not accurately represent the state of submissions when the performance
metrics were calculated.
