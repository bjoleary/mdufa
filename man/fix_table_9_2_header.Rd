\title{Fix Table 9.2 Header (MDUFA V)}
\usage{
fix_table_9_2_header(text_string)
}
\arguments{
\item{text_string}{The table content string (without title) to process.}
}
\value{
The string with Table 9.2 header cleaned up.
}
\description{
Table 9.2 in MDUFA V reports has a complex multi-line header with goal
descriptions that confuses the parser. This function removes those extra
header lines while preserving the FY columns and data rows.
}
\details{
There are two variants of this table:

CDRH variant (all FY columns on one line):
\preformatted{
|MDUFA V Goal (# of Submissions Received During FY with Written
|Feedback Provided by Day 70 or 5 Days Prior to Meeting)
Performance Metric|FY 2023|FY 2024|FY 2025|FY 2026|FY 2027
|90% / 75%|90% / 80%|90% Within|90% Within|90% Within
|Within MDUFA|Within MDUFA|MDUFA Goal|MDUFA Goal|MDUFA Goal
|Goal 1|Goal 2
}

CBER variant (FY columns split across lines):
\preformatted{
|MDUFA V Goal (# of Submissions Received During FY with Written
|Feedback Provided by Day 70 or 5 Days Prior to Meeting)
Performance Metric|FY 2023|FY 2024
|FY 2025|FY 2026|FY 2027
|90% / 75%|90% / 80%
Performance Metric|90% Within|90% Within|90% Within
|Within MDUFA Within MDUFA
|MDUFA Goal|MDUFA Goal|MDUFA Goal
|Goal 1|Goal 2
}

This function is called from get_table() when the table title indicates
Table 9.2. The text_string at that point does NOT include the title line.
}
