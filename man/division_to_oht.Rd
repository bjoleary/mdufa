\title{Division to OHT Mapping}
\format{
Named character vector where names are division codes and
values are OHT codes
}
\usage{
division_to_oht
}
\description{
Maps MDUFA III division codes to their corresponding OHT organization
codes used in MDUFA IV and V. Some divisions map 1:1, while IVD
divisions (DCTD, DIHD, DMD, DMGP) all map to OHT7.
}
\details{
Divisions that cannot be cleanly mapped (DAGRID, DOED, DSD, DRGUD)
are excluded from cross-MDUFA comparison as they were split or
combined during the reorganization.
