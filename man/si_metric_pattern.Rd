\title{Substantive Interaction Metric Pattern}
\usage{
si_metric_pattern()
}
\value{
a regular expression pattern
}
\description{
This function generates a regular expression pattern for matching performance
metrics associated with Substantive Interactions in text.
}
\details{
This function returns a regular expression pattern that matches three
different types of Substantive Interaction metrics: Average Number of
FDA/Industry days to Substantive Interaction, Xth Percentile FDA/Industry days
to Substantive Interaction, and Maximum FDA/Industry days to Substantive
Interaction. The function ignores case and does not match across multiple
lines.

The final word needs to be followed by a | for this expression to match.
